What is REST?
- Representational State Transfer: An architecture for web services
- Requests are made through HTTP and uses the same verbs:
  - GET:    Retrieve data from web service (Download existing)
  - POST:   Create new item on web service (Upload new)
  - PUT:    Update an item on web service  (Edit existing exactly)
  - PATCH:  Update item using instructions (Edit existing in 
            on how to modify                given pattern)
  - DELETE: Delete an item on web service  (Remove existing)

Web service APIs adhering to REST are called RESTful APIs, defined by:
- Base URI
- HTTP methods (verbs listed above)
- Media type for data such as JSON, XML, etc.

Media types usually need to provide services for multiple related but different thngs
e.g. Pizzas, Customers, Orders
-> Use routing to map URIs in logical divisions 
example: https://xxx.x/pizza -> PizzaController, https://.../order -> OrderController

(Controllers are classes that handle HTTP requests)
